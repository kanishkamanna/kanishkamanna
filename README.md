### Hi there 👋, I'm Kanishka. A Computational Postdoc. Welcome to my GitHub!

I live at the intersection between big data and biology. I have a keen interest in exploring and applying concepts from data science and computer science in bioinformatics and beyond!

- 💻 I'm passionate about developing *computational algorithms*, *bioinformatics pipelines* and tools for *visualizing* multi-omics (*genomics*, *transcriptomics* and *proteomics*) research. For this, I code in **python**, **R**, **Bash**, and anything else that piques my interest.

- 🧬 I believe in **open** science, **open** source software, and **reproducible** data analysis.

- 👨🏻‍🎓 I'm a Ph.D. graduate from the Joint Bioinformatics program at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

- 🌀 Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Nevada Bioinformatics Core | University of Nevada, Reno.
