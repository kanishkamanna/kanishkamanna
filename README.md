### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kanishka

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Joint Bioinformatics program at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. I'm passionate about developing bioinformatics pipelines, tools and algorithms. I'm particularly interested in exploring multi-omics data using machine learning techniques. I strongly believe in code/data reproducibility and reusability!
