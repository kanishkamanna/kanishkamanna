# 👋 Hi, I'm Kanishka!

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Nevada Bioinformatics Center**, University of Nevada, Reno, specializing in *multi-omics* data analysis, focusing on *proteogenomics* and *proteomics* research. I develop computational methods to uncover biological mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and explore disease processes using tools like **Nextflow**, **Snakemake**, **R**, and **Python**.

My research integrates *genomics*, *transcriptomics*, and *proteomics* data, along with *single-cell* version of these datasets, to explore cellular heterogeneity and unravel complex biological responses. I am passionate about using data science to derive actionable biological insights.

I am open to collaborations in multi-omics and bioinformatics. Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanishka-manna/) or explore my GitHub for my research and open-source projects.
